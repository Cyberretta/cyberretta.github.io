        After extracting the zip file, we can find a directory called <code>Triage</code> containing two sub-directories. One for the workstation and the other for the domain 
        controller. They both contain a <code>.evtx</code> file (Windows XML Event Log). To read those files, I will use 
        <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/full_event_log_view.html">FullEventLogView</a> from Nirsoft. The <code>Workstation</code> directory also contains some prefetch files 
        of the workstation.

    <h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
    <h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>
    <p><b>Analyzing Domain Controller Security Logs, can you confirm the date & time when the kerberoasting activity occurred ?</b></p>
    <p>
        To perform a kerberoasting attack, the attacker must request a service ticker first. When requesting a service ticket, an event with ID <code>4769</code> is created. We can 
        filter events with this information :
    </p>
    <img src="/write-ups/HackTheBox/Very easy/Campfire-1/image1.png"/>
    <p>According to HackTricks :</p>
    <blockquote>
        Kerberoasting tools typically request RC4 encryption when performing the attack and initiating TGS-REQ requests. This is because RC4 is weaker and easier to crack 
        offline using tools such as Hashcat than other encryption algorithms such as AES-128 and AES-256. RC4 (type 23) hashes begin with $krb5tgs$23$* while AES-256(type 18) 
        start with $krb5tgs$18$*.
    </blockquote>
    <p>So, with this information, we can filter events to show only the ones with RC4 used for ticket encryption :</p>
    <img src="/write-ups/HackTheBox/Very easy/Campfire-1/image2.png"/>
    <p>This gives us only one event. This event happened at <code>2024-05-21 03:18:09</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-2">Question 2</h2>
    <p><b>What is the Service Name that was targeted ?</b></p>
    <p>The service name target is <code>MSSQLService</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-3">Question 3</h2>
    <p><b>It is really important to identify the Workstation from which this activity occurred. What is the IP Address of the workstation ?</b></p>
    <p>The IP address of the workstation from which the activity occurred is <code>172.17.79.129</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Now that we have identified the workstation, a triage including PowerShell logs and Prefetch files are provided to you for some deeper insights so we can 
        understand how this activity occurred on the endpoint. What is the name of the file used to Enumerate Active directory objects and possibly find Kerberoastable 
        accounts in the network ?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The attacker may have used a PowerShell script to enumerate the domain to find kerberoastable accounts. By analysing the PowerShell event logs in 
        <code>Powershell-Operational.evtx</code>, we can filter events with event ID equal to <code>4104</code> :
    </p>
    <img src="/write-ups/HackTheBox/Very easy/Campfire-1/image3.png"/>
    <p>As we can see, by checking the description of some of the events we found, the attacker used <code>powerview.ps1</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-5">Question 5</h2>
    <p><b>When was this script executed ?</b></p>
    <p>The script was executed at <code>2024-05-21 03:16:32</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-6">Question 6</h2>
    <p><b>What is the full path of the tool used to perform the actual kerberoasting attack ?</b></p>
    <p>We can check the prefetch files from the workstation using WinPrefetchView from NirSoft :</p>
    <img src="/write-ups/HackTheBox/Very easy/Campfire-1/image4.png"/>
    <p>As we can see, the attacker used <code>Rubeus.exe</code>. The full path is <code>C:\Users\Alonzo.Spire\Downloads\Rubeus.exe</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="question-7">Question 7</h2>
    <p><b>When was the tool executed to dump credentials ?</b></p>
    <p><code>Rubeus.exe</code> was executed at <code>2024-05-21 03:18:08</code> to dump credentials.</p>
