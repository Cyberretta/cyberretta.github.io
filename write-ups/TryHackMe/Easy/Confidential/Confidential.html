    <p>Let's read the instructions of this room :</p>
    <blockquote>
        We got our hands on a confidential case file from some self-declared "black hat hackers"... it looks like they have a secret invite 
        code available within a QR code, but it's covered by some image in this PDF! If we want to thwart whatever it is they are planning, 
        we need your help to uncover what that QR code says ! Access this challenge by deploying the machine attached to this task by pressing 
        the green "Start Machine" button. This machine shows in Split View in your browser, if it doesn't automatically display you may need 
        to click "Show Split View" in the top right.<br>
        <br>
        The file you need is located in <code>/home/ubuntu/confidential</code> on the VM.

    <h1 id="get-the-qr-code">Get the QR Code</h1>
    <p>Let's take a look at the given pdf file :</p>
    <img src="/write-ups/TryHackMe/Easy/Confidential/image1.jpg"/>
    <p>
        So we need to uncover the QR Code. It seems that one image (the red sign) was placed over the other (the QR Code). If it's two separate 
        images, it's maybe possible to extract them from the pdf file. After some research, I found that you can extract images from a pdf file 
        using <code>pdfimages</code> from <a href="https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/poppler-utils#poppler-utils">Poppler-utils</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Let's use this tool to extract images from the pdf file :</p>
    <div class="codeBlock">ubuntu@thm-confidential:~/confidential$ pdfimages Repdf.pdf image
ubuntu@thm-confidential:~/confidential$ ls
Repdf.pdf  image-000.ppm  image-001.ppm  image-002.ppm</div>
        <p>We successfuly extracted three images from the pdf file :</p>
        <img src="/write-ups/TryHackMe/Easy/Confidential/image2.jpg"/>
        <p>
            Now we can read the QR Code. But be careful, you should never scan an unknown QR Code, you can use online tools for this. I 
            used <a href="https://webqr.com/index.html">Web QR</a> :
        </p>
        <img src="/write-ups/TryHackMe/Easy/Confidential/image3.jpg"/>
        <p>And we have the flag !</p>
